# Unveiling-Amazon-Prime-Video-Trends-with-Power-BI
This project delves into the world of Amazon Prime Video using an interactive Power BI dashboard. It empowers you to explore various aspects of the platform's content library, revealing valuable insights through a combination of compelling visualizations.
## Key Visualizations:

- ### Rating Popularity (Bar Chart):
  Discover which show ratings attract the most content, helping tailor recommendations or marketing strategies.
- ### Content Type Distribution (Doughnut Chart):
   Gain a clear picture of the proportion of movies versus TV shows available, informing content acquisition or production decisions.
- ### Global Viewing Trends (Map):
 Visualize how show ratings vary across different countries, uncovering potentially untapped markets or regional preferences.
- ### Release Year and Content Type (Area Chart):
  Analyze trends in content types (movies vs. TV shows) over time, understanding viewers' evolving preferences.
- ### List Inclusion by Rating (Stacked Column Chart):
  Explore whether highly-rated shows are more likely to appear on user lists, potentially guiding content curation efforts.
## How it Works:

- ### Data Loading:
   Connect your Amazon Prime Video data source (potentially a CSV file or API) to Power BI.
- ### Data Transformation (Optional):
   Clean and transform the data if necessary (e.g., handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies) to ensure accurate analysis.
- ### Visualization Creation:
  Utilize Power BI's visual library to create the following charts:
- ### Bar Chart:
  Shows the count of show IDs for each rating (1 star, 2 stars, etc.).
  ### Doughnut Chart:
   Illustrates the proportion of movie and TV show IDs within the data.
- ### Map:
  Plots the count of show IDs by country, colored by average rating.
- ### Area Chart:
   Overlays the count of show IDs by release year for both movies and TV shows.
- ###  Stacked Column Chart:
   Groups shows by rating and displays the count of IDs within each "Listed" and "Not Listed" category.
- ### Dashboard Assembly:
  Arrange the created visualizations in a visually appealing and informative layout on your Power BI dashboard. Add titles, labels, and legends for clear communication.
- ### Interactivity (Optional):
-  Consider incorporating slicers or filters to allow users to explore specific content types, ratings, or countries for deeper insights.
##  Benefits:

- ### Data-Driven Decisions:
   Make informed choices about content acquisition, marketing strategies, and user experience based on the visualized trends.
- ### Targeted Recommendations:
   Understand audience preferences for different types of content and ratings, facilitating recommendations tailored to individual users.
- ### Global Audience Insights:
   Identify regional variations in viewing trends to optimize content offerings and marketing efforts across different markets.
### Sharing on GitHub:

Once your dashboard is complete, you can save it as a Power BI Packaged Workbook (.pbix) and share it directly on your GitHub repository.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of Power BI's visualizations, you'll be well on your way to creating an insightful dashboard that unlocks valuable insights into the world of Amazon Prime Video.
